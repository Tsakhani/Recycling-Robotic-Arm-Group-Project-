This project showcases a fully developed robotic arm system designed to automatically sort plastic bottles from waste streams using machine learning and computer vision. 
The system operates autonomously, with a Raspberry Pi handling object detection, classification, and movement control of the robotic arm.

Key Features
Real-time object detection using a Raspberry Pi camera and TensorFlow Lite.
Efficient image processing powered by OpenCV.
Precise robotic arm control for gripping and sorting plastic bottles using an SG90 micro servo.
Seamless Wi-Fi communication for remote monitoring and control.

Technologies Used
Raspberry Pi: Central control unit for detection, classification, and movement.
TensorFlow Lite: Enables lightweight, real-time object detection.
OpenCV: Facilitates image processing tasks.
Python: Core programming language for the entire system.
Socket Programming: Manages Wi-Fi-based communication between components.

Project Impact
This solution offers a scalable approach to automating waste management processes, reducing manual labor, and enhancing recycling efficiency. 
The system is ready for further expansion to handle a broader range of recyclable materials.
